He was no longer evil, just inconvenient: the bureaucrat''s delay, the inventor''s frustration, the scholar''s pause.","By the industrial age, Impede had lost his shackles but kept his habit. He haunted the gears of systems, not the feet of soldiers. Processes stalled; reforms slowed; traffic stopped. The moral heat was gone—only procedure remained. What began in the body ended in the machine.","He was adopted by Charlemagne''s scribes to describe the weight of imperial decrees—where law became the shackle that bound the realm together.
