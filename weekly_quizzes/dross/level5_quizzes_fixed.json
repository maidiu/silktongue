      "1st c. CE — Rome → In Rome, she was *verisimilitudo*—'truthlikeness.' Philosophers built her from *verus* ('true') and *similis* ('like'), a concept born of resemblance. She lived in the space between certainty and illusion, where rhetoricians worked. To have verisimilitude was to speak what seemed true when proof was distant. Cicero knew her well: she was the orator's art.",
      "14th c. — Medieval Poetics → When Aristotle's *Poetics* returned to European thought through Arabic translations, Verisimilitude found new purpose. Medieval scholars called her the soul of narrative—what made a tale feel true even when invention shaped it. She wasn't deception; she was craft. Fiction could teach by seeming real.",
      "17th c. — Rise of the Novel → In England's coffee houses and theaters, she arrived as *verisimilitude*—French *vraisemblance* dressed in Latin gravity. Critics demanded it of playwrights; novelists studied it like scripture. Defoe and Richardson built worlds that breathed because of her. She had become the measure of art: not truth, but its convincing performance.",
      "19th c. — Realist Movement → The realists took her seriously—Flaubert, Tolstoy, Eliot. Every detail mattered now. Verisimilitude demanded research, observation, the texture of lived life. She grew exacting, almost scientific. To write without her was to betray the reader. She had become the conscience of fiction.",
      "20th c. — Modern Media → In courtrooms she found work: forensic verisimilitude, the story that fits the evidence. In cinema she became spectacle: CGI that feels tangible, worlds that seem real enough to touch. Philosophers questioned her ethics—could a lie made lifelike be trusted? But she endures, untroubled: wherever truth is absent and belief is needed, she waits."
