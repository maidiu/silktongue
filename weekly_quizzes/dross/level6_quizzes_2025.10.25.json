      "9th c. \u2014 Anglo-Saxon Warrior Culture \u2192 In Old English, he was *st\u00e6df\u00e6st*\u2014'firm in place.' *St\u00e6d* meant a place, a standing-ground; *f\u00e6st* meant fixed. Together they named what held its spot. Warriors stood steadfast in shield-walls; oaths remained steadfast in memory. He was physical before he was moral\u2014not yet loyalty but position, not yet faith but footing. The stone does not move, the word does not break.",
      "14th c. \u2014 Medieval Chivalry \u2192 When chivalry made virtue ritual, Steadfast put on honor's colors. The knight who stood steadfast in battle stood steadfast in vows. What began as physical holding became moral holding. Fealty, faith, friendship\u2014all required steadfastness. He learned to name not just standing but staying, not just position but persistence. The shield-wall became the oath-wall; the enemy without became the doubt within.",
      "17th c. \u2014 Renaissance Poetry \u2192 When poets sang of love, they summoned him. The steadfast heart that beats one name; the steadfast gaze that never strays. He became the language of constancy\u2014not just loyalty but devotion, not just persistence but passion that endures. What began as military courage became romantic fidelity. The standing warrior became the standing lover; the battle-line became the marriage vow.",
      "19th c. \u2014 Romantic Philosophy \u2192 The Romantics gave him philosophy. Steadfastness became not just virtue but identity\u2014the self that knows itself and holds. In changing times, the steadfast heart stayed true; in shifting values, the steadfast mind held course. He learned the language of authenticity: not stubbornness but integrity, not rigidity but resolve. What could not be moved defined the person who chose not to move."
