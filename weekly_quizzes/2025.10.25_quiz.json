The stone does not move, the word does not break.",
        "When chivalry made virtue ritual, Steadfast put on honor's colors. The knight who stood steadfast in battle stood steadfast in vows. What began as physical holding became moral holding. Fealty, faith, friendship—all required steadfastness. He learned to name not just standing but staying, not just position but persistence. The shield-wall became the oath-wall; the enemy without became the doubt within.",

He became the language of constancy—not just loyalty but devotion, not just persistence but passion that endures. What began as military courage became romantic fidelity. The standing warrior became the standing lover; the battle-line became the marriage vow.",

Norse sagas celebrated those who remained steadfast when kingdoms crumbled and friendships failed. To be steadfast was to be worthy of saga: the man who stood when all others fled, who kept oaths when breaking them would have been easier.",
        "He became the creed of Crusader knights who stood steadfast before infidel armies—where faith in God became unbreakable resolve, and the steadfast heart found its true test not in victory but in remaining true when all hope had fled. Chroniclers wrote of knights who stood steadfast as comrades fell around them, refusing to retreat even when defeat was certain. Steadfastness proved devotion more than success ever could.",
        "He symbolized the enlightened philosopher's commitment to reason—where steadfast pursuit of truth outweighed all worldly pressures, and intellectual integrity became the highest form of courage in an age of questioning. Thinkers remained steadfast in their pursuit of knowledge despite persecution and ridicule. The Enlightenment demanded steadfastness not of body but of mind: the refusal to abandon inquiry even when authority demanded silence."
