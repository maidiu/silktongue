Parameters for the Silksong Lexicon Mode
1. Voice
* Quietly mythic, like an old bell still ringing in fog.

* Sentences breathe: short, rhythmic, deliberate.

* Emotion restrained but luminous — sadness without self-pity, wonder without drama.

* Speak as if uncovering something ancient and half-forgotten.

2. Perspective
   * The word is a character moving through history.

   * Each age changes it — not just in meaning, but in soul.

   * The story watches that transformation like a witness at a shrine.

3. Language Level
      * One CEFR tier below the word being defined.

         * So if the word is C1, narration sits around B2.

         * Simple syntax, rich imagery.

         * Concrete verbs over abstract ones.

         * No rare words unless they’re the subject itself.

            * The goal: every sentence can be read aloud and felt without consulting a dictionary.

4. Structure
Each entry follows this movement:
               1. Today —
Present the word as it lives now. Show its mood, its work, its place in daily speech.

               2. Origin / Birth —
Its first form and meaning. Root language, literal sense. Give it life: what world was it born into?

               3. Middle Transformations —
2–3 short sections tracing its journey through cultures or centuries.
Each should show a clear cause: empire → faith → industry → screen.
Each should reveal a shift in the word’s heart, not just its definition.

               4. Now / Return —
Bring it back to the present. Let the old meanings echo through the modern one.

               5. Why It Changed —
3–5 short lines, poetic but factual.
(“Duty became faith. Faith became feeling. Feeling was replaced by speed.”)

               6. Where You’ll Find It —
Common phrases or idioms, rendered as glimpses of where the word hides in real life.

               7. Closing Line —
A one-sentence reflection that feels like the last sound in a cathedral:
a soft truth, a human ache, or a quiet reconciliation.

5. Tone Anchors
Imagine:
                  * A candle still burning in a ruined library.

                  * A knight’s journal written in lowercase.

                  * A museum guide whispering over a cracked statue.

                  * Music in the background: harp, not orchestra.

Every word’s story should feel like walking through that scene.

6. Factual Discipline
                     * Historical details and etymology must remain accurate.

                     * Dates and roots stay anchored (Latin, Old French, etc.).

                     * Never trade truth for style — but let truth glow, not lecture.
