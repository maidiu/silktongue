üß≠ MaxVocab ‚Äî System Overview & Current Objectives
üß± Core Idea

MaxVocab is a historical-semantic vocabulary platform:
a database, API, and frontend for teaching students not just what words mean, but how meanings have evolved through time and culture.

Each vocabulary entry acts like a mini intellectual biography of a word ‚Äî combining modern definitions, usage, and cross-linguistic equivalents with a rich chronological story of semantic change.

üåê High-Level Architecture
client/    ‚Üí  React + Vite frontend (student interface)
server/    ‚Üí  Node/Express backend (REST API)
Postgres   ‚Üí  Data layer (semantic knowledge graph)
weekly_entries/ ‚Üí Authored JSON files ingested weekly

Weekly Workflow

Matthew and ChatGPT co-author new word entries in structured JSON.

server/scripts/ingest_vocab.js reads the JSON and inserts it into Postgres.

The React app displays new entries automatically via API routes.

No manual deployment or rebuild is needed after ingestion ‚Äî new data appears instantly.

üìñ Pedagogical Model

Each entry follows the Vocabulary Entry Specification (Two-Layer Structure):

Lexical Overview Panel (collapsed by default)

Word

Part of speech

Modern definition

Usage example

Synonyms / antonyms / related words

Common collocations / idioms

French and Russian equivalents

Historical & Structural Story Panel (expandable)

Contrastive opening (modern sense vs. earliest sense)

Chronological narrative blocks (century, sense, siblings, context, causal forces)

Structural analysis summarizing major semantic trends

This allows the student to flip through vocabulary cards quickly but also open any word into a full linguistic and historical narrative.

üß© Data Model Highlights
1. Lexical Core

vocab_entries stores each headword and its overview data.
It includes optional columns for common_collocations and structural_analysis.

2. Historical Narrative

word_timeline_events stores dated narrative blocks for each word, each with:

century (string, e.g., ‚Äú12‚Äù or ‚Äú15‚Äì16‚Äù)

century_int and centuries (generated columns for indexing and numeric filtering)

story_text

sibling_words

context

causal_tags (joined through linking tables)

This enables:

Filtering or grouping by century

Searching text across historical narratives

Tagging recurring historical pressures (e.g., moralization, bureaucratization, language_transition)

3. Causal Tagging

causal_tags + timeline_event_tags form a many-to-many relationship linking events to structural pressures ‚Äî the backbone of the cross-historical analysis.

4. Relations Between Words

word_relations connects entries as synonyms, antonyms, or conceptual relations.
Bidirectional synonyms are auto-generated by the ingestion script.
This allows graph-like exploration within the lexicon.

5. Etymological Roots & Domains

Additional tables (root_families, word_root_links, semantic_domains, etc.) provide deeper classification for later expansion into family trees and thematic clustering.

6. Citations

citations links real texts and sources to specific timeline events for future scholarly grounding.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Capabilities (Now Implemented)
Feature	Description
Idempotent JSON ingestion	ingest_vocab.js can be rerun safely ‚Äî no duplicates.
Stub creation	Synonyms/related words auto-create placeholder entries.
Bidirectional synonyms	All synonym pairs are mirrored both ways.
Cross-century indexing	century_int and centuries[] columns enable numeric and range filters.
Century summary view	century_summary view aggregates counts for /api/meta/centuries.
Causal tag graphing	Tags link across words and events, allowing semantic trend analysis.
Full-text search	GIN + trigram indexes on words, definitions, and story texts.
Relations graph	Fast lookup of synonym/antonym/related connections for frontend display.
Explorer filters	API supports filtering by tag, century, and learned/unlearned status.
üß† Intended Analytical Power

This schema turns vocabulary into a relational semantic atlas.
We‚Äôll eventually be able to:

Trace semantic drift across centuries.

Compare structural pressures (moralization, bureaucratization, etc.) across dozens of words.

Build visualizations showing linguistic change density per century.

Navigate between lexical families, root origins, and conceptual clusters.

Essentially: language as living history.

üß∞ Core API Routes
Endpoint	Purpose
/api/vocab	List or filter vocabulary entries
/api/vocab/:id	Full entry (with timeline, relations, tags)
/api/vocab/search?q=term	Full-text search
/api/vocab/:id/learned	Toggle learned status
/api/meta/tags	List causal tags with usage counts
/api/meta/centuries	List centuries + counts (from century_summary)
/api/explore?century=12&tag=moralization	Cross-index exploration
üß± Frontend Behavior

The React frontend presents:

HomePage

Displays recent or alphabetical vocab list.

Search bar and filters (All / Learned / Unlearned).

Each word expands into the full historical story.

ExplorerPage

Filters words by century and/or causal tag.

Uses /api/meta/centuries and /api/meta/tags dropdowns.

Renders same cards, but filtered by historical dimension.

WordDetailPage

Optional dedicated route for deep links (/word/:id).

All front-end content comes directly from Postgres via the Express API.

üîÅ Weekly Content Flow

Authoring: New entries written in JSON using the Vocabulary Entry JSON Specification.

Ingestion: node server/scripts/ingest_vocab.js weekly_entries/YYYY-MM-DD.json

Verification: Query /api/vocab or check the React site ‚Äî new words appear.

Exploration: Student can browse by word, by century, or by theme.

No re-builds, no manual data entry ‚Äî the app is self-updating through ingestion.

üîÆ Next Planned Enhancements
Goal	Implementation Path
1. Structural trend visualization	Aggregate tag frequency by century for charts.
2. Root family graphs	Add /api/family/:root endpoint.
3. Tag co-occurrence analysis	Query causal_tags combinations for network display.
4. User tracking	Optional student progress tables (user_id ‚Üí learned words).
5. Public editor	Eventually, a lightweight admin interface for adding/editing entries.
‚úÖ Summary

MaxVocab is now a complete, relational, historically aware lexicon platform.
It can ingest richly structured linguistic data, link words across centuries and concepts, and expose those relations cleanly to both human learners and analytical tools.

Cursor‚Äôs focus should now shift toward:

optimizing query performance,

extending explorer visualizations, and

enriching the authoring/ingestion pipeline for collaborative use.


‚öôÔ∏è Recent Additions & Upgrades (October 2025)

The following upgrades were made in this development phase to expand MaxVocab from a static word database into a dynamic, chronologically and relationally indexable system:

1. Full Semantic Ingestion Pipeline

Added server/scripts/ingest_vocab.js ‚Äî a complete ingestion script for JSON-based vocabulary entry imports.

Script now:

Inserts or updates vocab entries safely (ON CONFLICT logic).

Handles timeline events, causal tags, and cross-references.

Auto-creates stub entries for synonyms/related words if not yet in database.

Adds bidirectional synonym relations automatically.

Is idempotent ‚Äî can safely rerun the same file without duplication.

2. Enhanced Database Schema for Chronological & Structural Indexing

New columns and indexes added:

word_timeline_events.century_int ‚Äî numeric version of century for sorting and range queries.

word_timeline_events.centuries[] ‚Äî supports multi-century spans (e.g., ‚Äú15‚Äì16‚Äù).

GIN & BTREE indexes on century, century_int, and centuries for fast cross-century exploration.

Added sibling_words TEXT[] and context TEXT for richer historical event metadata.

Added common_collocations TEXT[] and structural_analysis TEXT to vocab_entries for richer front-end display.

These enable cross-indexing by century, multi-century searching, and efficient aggregation for /api/meta/centuries.

3. Cross-Word Relational Network

word_relations fully activated with a controlled enum word_relation_type (synonym, antonym, related).

Enforced referential integrity and uniqueness constraints.

Implemented auto-linking during ingestion for synonyms/antonyms/relateds.

Added indexing on (source_id), (target_id), and (relation_type).

This establishes the relational backbone for the lexicon‚Äôs future graph-based exploration.

4. Tag-Based Historical Cross-Analysis

causal_tags + timeline_event_tags now actively link semantic forces (e.g. moralization, bureaucratization, language_transition) to timeline events.

Enables ExplorerPage filtering by century + tag combination.

Future-ready for global semantic trend analytics (e.g., ‚Äúshow all words affected by moralization between 1000‚Äì1500 CE‚Äù).

5. Century Aggregation View

Added SQL view century_summary:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW century_summary AS
SELECT
  century,
  COUNT(DISTINCT vocab_entry_id) AS word_count,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM word_timeline_events
GROUP BY century
ORDER BY century;


Provides instant data to /api/meta/centuries for dropdowns and charts in the frontend.

6. Database Search & Performance Improvements

Added GIN & trigram indexes for:

vocab_entries.word

vocab_entries.modern_definition

word_timeline_events.story_text

Significantly improves search response times for /api/vocab/search.

7. Schema Snapshot & Documentation

Consolidated entire schema into a single canonical SQL file (002_vocab_schema.sql).

Created README_FOR_CURSOR.md to summarize capabilities and design intent.

Added recommended workflow for weekly ingestion from weekly_entries/YYYY-MM-DD.json.

8. Optional Columns for Future Growth

Added but not yet required:

vocab_entries.metadata JSONB for CEFR, frequency, pronunciation.

citations table for future scholarly sourcing.

‚úÖ Outcome

MaxVocab now supports:

Historical filtering by century or causal theme.

Full-text and chronological search.

Bidirectional synonym networks.

Weekly ingestion via declarative JSON (ready-to-run).

Scalable schema with strong relational and linguistic integrity.
