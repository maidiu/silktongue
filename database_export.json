Built from *ob-* ('away') + *mittere* ('to send'), he belonged to a family of doers—*remittere, permittere, submittere*. They all acted; he refrained. His meaning was the negative space of will: to set aside, to leave undone.\",\"12th c. — Medieval Theology → In the age of confession, he was moralized. *Omettre* became a sin of silence—a thing not done when duty called. His neutrality vanished. To omit was to fail the soul, not the sentence.\",\"15th c. — Late Medieval Bureaucracy → When the monks became clerks and the parchment became proof, Omit found a new stage. He lived in records now, where what was left out could ruin fortunes. His sin became paperwork.\",\"16th c. — Renaissance Printing → With printing presses and ledgers multiplying, Omit shed his guilt. To omit was now an act of editing—a choice, not a failure. The blank became a craft.\",\"20th c. — Modern English → Now he walks between worlds: neutral in documents, moral in sermons, rhetorical in debate. He survives in phrases like fossils—'sins of omission,' 'lies of omission'—ghosts of the age when absence was blame.\"}",

Salient began as motion, not metaphor.\",\"16th c. — Renaissance Architecture → By the Renaissance, *saillant* in French meant 'jutting out'—a wall that leaned toward the world, a bastion pointing at the horizon. English borrowed him as an engineer's and soldier's term: the salient angle of a fortress, the place that struck first and was struck hardest.\",\"17th c. — Early Philosophy → Then the leap turned inward. Philosophers and rhetoricians called an idea 'salient' when it sprang to the mind. The fortification became a thought: something projecting beyond the rest. To leap became to signify.\",\"19th c. — Modern Analysis → By the modern age, Salient had settled into analysis and argument. He no longer moved; he marked. To be salient was to stand out by design, not by motion. Yet in every use, his ancient spring survives—the mind's leap made permanent in language.\"}",
