        "1st c. CE — Rome → Long ago, in Rome, he was *impedire*—'to shackle the feet.' Built from *in-* ('in, upon') and *pes/pedis* ('foot'), he was born of the body. To impede was to bind, to trap motion itself. Soldiers felt him in their tangled nets; lawyers in their endless petitions. His world was literal: movement stopped by weight or chain.",
        "14th c. — Medieval Christianity → When the Empire's dust settled and prayers replaced campaigns, Impede crossed into Old French as *empedier*. He kept his fetters, but their meaning shifted. The soul now had feet. To sin was to stumble; to be virtuous was to walk unchained. In sermons he became the enemy of grace—the snag that kept the spirit from moving freely toward God.",
        "16th c. — Renaissance Humanism → Then the Renaissance arrived, and with it, motion itself became a metaphor. Discovery, reform, progress—everyone was moving somewhere new. Impede, still dragging his ancient chains, now followed minds instead of bodies. He was no longer evil, just inconvenient: the bureaucrat's delay, the inventor's frustration, the scholar's pause.",
        "19th c. — Industrial Age → By the industrial age, Impede had lost his shackles but kept his habit. He haunted the gears of systems, not the feet of soldiers. Processes stalled; reforms slowed; traffic stopped. The moral heat was gone—only procedure remained. What began in the body ended in the machine."
